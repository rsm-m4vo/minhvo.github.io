randomization mechanism, I provide a series of tests that compare aspects of the treatment and control groups to assess whether they are statistically significantly different from one another.\ntodo: test a few variables other than the key outcome variables (for example, test months since last donation) to see if the treatment and control groups are statistically significantly different at the 95% confidence level. Do each as a t-test and separately as a linear regression, and confirm you get the exact same results from both methods. When doing a t-test, use the formula in the class slides. When doing the linear regression, regress for example mrm2 on treatment and look at the estimated coefficient on the treatment variable. It might be helpful to compare parts of your analysis to Table 1 in the paper. Be sure to comment on your results (hint: why is Table 1 included in the paper)."

    "text": "Experimental Results\n\nCharitable Contribution Made\nFirst, I analyze whether matched donations lead to an increased response rate of making a donation.\ntodo: make a barplot with two bars. Each bar is the proportion of people who donated. One bar for treatment and one bar for control.\ntodo: run a t-test between the treatment and control groups on the binary outcome of whether any charitable donation was made. Also run a bivariate linear regression that demonstrates the same finding. (It may help to confirm your calculations match Table 2a Panel A.) Report your statistical results and interpret them in the context of the experiment (e.g., if you found a difference with a small p-value or that was statistically significant at some threshold, what have you learned about human behavior? Use mostly English words, not numbers or stats, to explain your finding.)\ntodo: run a probit regression where the outcome variable is whether any charitable donation was made and the explanatory variable is assignment to treatment or control. Confirm that your results replicate Table 3 column 1 in the paper.\n\n# Proportion barplot\nprop_data &lt;- df %&gt;%\n  group_by(treatment) %&gt;%\n  summarise(rate = mean(gave))\n\nggplot(prop_data, aes(x = factor(treatment), y = rate, fill = factor(treatment))) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  labs(x = \"Group\", y = \"Proportion Donated\", fill = \"Group\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Donation Rate by Treatment Group\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# T-test and linear regression\nwith(df, t.test(gave ~ treatment))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave by treatment\nt = -3.2095, df = 36577, p-value = 0.001331\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means between group 0 and group 1 is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.006733310 -0.001627399\nsample estimates:\nmean in group 0 mean in group 1 \n     0.01785821      0.02203857 \n\nsummary(lm(gave ~ treatment, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ treatment, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02204 -0.02204 -0.02204 -0.01786  0.98214 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

For example, does the 2:1 match rate lead increase the likelihood that someone donates as compared to the 1:1 match rate? Do your results support the “figures suggest” comment the authors make on page 8?\ntodo: Assess the same issue using a regression. Specifically, create the variable ratio1 then regress gave on ratio1, ratio2, and ratio3 (or alternatively, regress gave on the categorical variable ratio). Interpret the coefficients and their statistical precision.\ntodo: Calculate the response rate difference between the 1:1 and 2:1 match ratios and the 2:1 and 3:1 ratios. Do this directly from the data, and do it by computing the differences in the fitted coefficients of the previous regression. what do you conclude regarding the effectiveness of different sizes of matched donations?\n\n# Compare 1:1 vs 2:1 match\nwith(df, t.test(gave[ratio2 == 1], gave[ratio == 1]))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave[ratio2 == 1] and gave[ratio == 1]\nt = 0.96505, df = 22225, p-value = 0.3345\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.001942773  0.005711275\nsample estimates:\n mean of x  mean of y \n0.02263338 0.02074912 \n\n# Compare 2:1 vs 3:1 match\nwith(df, t.test(gave[ratio3 == 1], gave[ratio2 == 1]))\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  gave[ratio3 == 1] and gave[ratio2 == 1]\nt = 0.050116, df = 22261, p-value = 0.96\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.003811996  0.004012044\nsample estimates:\n mean of x  mean of y \n0.02273340 0.02263338 \n\n# Regression\nsummary(lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02273 -0.02263 -0.01902 -0.01902  0.98098 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std.

What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot.\n\n# Bivariate regression\nsummary(lm(amount ~ treatment, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = amount ~ treatment, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n -0.97  -0.97  -0.97  -0.81 399.03 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.
