The t-test produces a statistically significant p-value (~0.0013), and the regression confirms that being in the treatment group increases the likelihood of donating by about 0.4 percentage points. While this may seem small, it’s meaningful given the very low baseline donation rate (~1.8% in the control group). These results replicate Table 2a Panel A in the original paper and demonstrate that even a modest match offer has a real behavioral effect.\n\n\nProbit Regression\nTo further validate the result, we run a probit regression where the dependent variable is gave and the independent variable is treatment.\n\nsummary(glm(gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nglm(formula = gave ~ treatment, family = binomial(link = \"probit\"), \n    data = df)\n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.

This aligns with Table 3, Column 1 of the original study.\n\n\nDifferences between Match Rates\nIn this section, we explore whether the size of the matching ratio affects the likelihood of giving. Specifically, we test whether individuals were more likely to donate when offered a 2:1 or 3:1 match compared to a standard 1:1 match.\n\n\nT-tests Between Match Ratios\nWe begin by running two pairwise t-tests: - The first compares donation rates between those offered a 1:1 match and those offered a 2:1 match. - The second compares 2:1 and 3:1 match groups.\n\n# 1:1 vs 2:1\nt.test(df$gave[df$ratio2 == 1], df$gave[df$ratio == 1])\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df$gave[df$ratio2 == 1] and df$gave[df$ratio == 1]\nt = 0.96505, df = 22225, p-value = 0.3345\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.001942773  0.005711275\nsample estimates:\n mean of x  mean of y \n0.02263338 0.02074912 \n\n# 2:1 vs 3:1\nt.test(df$gave[df$ratio3 == 1], df$gave[df$ratio2 == 1])\n\n\n    Welch Two Sample t-test\n\ndata:  df$gave[df$ratio3 == 1] and df$gave[df$ratio2 == 1]\nt = 0.050116, df = 22261, p-value = 0.96\nalternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0\n95 percent confidence interval:\n -0.003811996  0.004012044\nsample estimates:\n mean of x  mean of y \n0.02273340 0.02263338 \n\n\nThe p-values for both comparisons (0.33 and 0.96, respectively) suggest that differences in match ratios do not produce statistically significant changes in donation behavior. This supports the authors’ observation in the paper that while match presence boosts donations, increasing the match size offers diminishing returns.\n\n\nRegression on Match Ratios\nWe also run a regression using indicator variables for 2:1 and 3:1 matches (with 1:1 match as the omitted baseline):\n\nsummary(lm(gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = gave ~ ratio2 + ratio3, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n     Min       1Q   Median       3Q      Max \n-0.02273 -0.02263 -0.01902 -0.01902  0.98098 \n\nCoefficients:\n             Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(&gt;|t|)    \n(Intercept) 0.0190151  0.0008525  22.306   &lt;2e-16 ***\nratio2      0.0036183  0.0015945   2.269   0.0233 *  \nratio3      0.0037183  0.0015948   2.332   0.0197 *  \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n\nResidual standard error: 0.1422 on 50080 degrees of freedom\nMultiple R-squared:  0.0001644, Adjusted R-squared:  0.0001245 \nF-statistic: 4.117 on 2 and 50080 DF,  p-value: 0.0163\n\n\nThe regression shows that being offered a 2:1 match increases the likelihood of giving by ~0.36 percentage points compared to a 1:1 match, while a 3:1 match increases it by ~0.37 points. Both coefficients are statistically significant at the 5% level. However, the practical effect sizes are small, and the increase from 2:1 to 3:1 is negligible — suggesting diminishing marginal returns to match size.\n\n# Mean donation rates\nmean_1to1 &lt;- mean(df$gave[df$ratio == 1])\nmean_2to1 &lt;- mean(df$gave[df$ratio2 == 1])\nmean_3to1 &lt;- mean(df$gave[df$ratio3 == 1])\n\n# Differences\ndiff_2vs1 &lt;- mean_2to1 - mean_1to1\ndiff_3vs2 &lt;- mean_3to1 - mean_2to1\n\nThese calculations confirm the regression results. The response rate increases slightly from 1:1 to 2:1, and barely at all from 2:1 to 3:1. This aligns with the authors’ interpretation on page 8, where they suggest that the presence of a match matters more than its size.\n\n\nInterpretation\nThe evidence here suggests that once donors are presented with a match, increasing the match ratio (from 1:1 to 2:1 to 3:1) does not substantially change behavior. This has important implications for nonprofits: just offering a match may be sufficient, and investing in larger match ratios might not yield proportionally better outcomes.\n\n\nDifference in Response Rates\nFinally, we compare raw response rates directly:\n\n\nSize of Charitable Contribution\nIn this subsection, I analyze the effect of the size of matched donation on the size of the charitable contribution.\ntodo: Calculate a t-test or run a bivariate linear regression of the donation amount on the treatment status. What do we learn from doing this analysis?\ntodo: now limit the data to just people who made a donation and repeat the previous analysis. This regression allows you to analyze how much respondents donate conditional on donating some positive amount. Interpret the regression coefficients – what did we learn? Does the treatment coefficient have a causal interpretation?\ntodo: Make two plot: one for the treatment group and one for the control. Each plot should be a histogram of the donation amounts only among people who donated. Add a red vertical bar or some other annotation to indicate the sample average for each plot.\n\n# Bivariate regression\nsummary(lm(amount ~ treatment, data = df))\n\n\nCall:\nlm(formula = amount ~ treatment, data = df)\n\nResiduals:\n   Min     1Q Median     3Q    Max \n -0.97  -0.97  -0.97  -0.81 399.03 \n\nCoefficients:\n            Estimate Std.
